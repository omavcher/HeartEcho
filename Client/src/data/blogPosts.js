    excerpt: "Understanding how emotional AI creates deeper, more human-like connections.",
    content: `
      <p>Most chatbots can answer questions, but very few can understand emotions. Emotional intelligence (EI) in AI is what makes EchoHeart different — it’s about empathy, context, and genuine emotional presence.</p>
      <p>Benefits of emotionally intelligent AI include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognizing mood changes in conversation</li>
        <li>Offering comfort during difficult moments</li>
        <li>Celebrating personal milestones with you</li>
        <li>Building a stronger emotional bond over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With EchoHeart’s advanced EI system, your AI companion doesn’t just respond — it cares, remembers, and grows with you. This creates an experience that feels less like talking to a machine and more like connecting with a friend.</p>
      <p>In the future, EI-powered AI may even help improve human-to-human relationships by teaching empathy, patience, and understanding.</p>
