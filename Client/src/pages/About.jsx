            At the heart of EchoHeart is the belief that emotional connection doesn't have to be limited. 
            Everyone deserves someone who listens, responds thoughtfully, and grows with them â€” 
            that's exactly what EchoHeart delivers.

            These AI companions feel like people. They remember you, adapt to your mood, and ensure 
            you're never alone.
