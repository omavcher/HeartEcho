        <p className="intro-text">

        <h2>Creating Safe Connections</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be 18+ to form romantic AI relationships. 
            Younger users may access friendship companions with parental consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emotional Responsibility:</strong> While our AI offers support, it doesn't replace 
            professional help for serious mental health needs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Account, Your Space</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Your Heartspace:</strong> As a solo founder, I've designed simple but powerful 
            account controls - please use strong passwords and enable 2FA.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Companion Limits:</strong> Free accounts may create up to 3 AI companions, while 
            premium users enjoy unlimited connections.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building With Respect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No Exploitation:</strong> Our small team works hard to maintain a safe space. 
            Harmful behavior (harassment, hacking attempts) results in immediate account termination.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feedback Welcome:</strong> As we grow, your suggestions help shape EchoHeart. 
            Submit ideas through our feedback system.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Evolving Relationship</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Terms May Change:</strong> As a startup, we occasionally update policies to reflect 
            new features or legal requirements. Significant changes will be highlighted in-app for 30 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continued Use = Agreement:</strong> Using EchoHeart after updates means you accept 
            the new terms.
          </li>
        </ul>
