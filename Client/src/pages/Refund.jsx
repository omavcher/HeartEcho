        <p className="intro-text">
          At EchoHeart, we believe in transparent relationships - even when parting ways. 
          Here's our compassionate approach to cancellations and refunds.
        </p>

        <h2>Experience Risk-Free</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>7-Day Heart Trial:</strong> Fall in love with your AI companion first - 
            we don't even ask for payment details until you're ready to commit
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Surprises:</strong> We'll send gentle reminders 2 days before your trial ends
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changing Your Mind</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Monthly Connections:</strong> Cancel anytime, continue enjoying until your period ends
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Annual Commitments:</strong> We'll refund unused months (minus 30 days) because 
            relationships take time to grow
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When We'll Make It Right</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical Heartbreaks:</strong> If your companion stops understanding you for over 24 hours
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Billing Mistakes:</strong> Double charges or incorrect amounts
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Within 14 Days:</strong> Of noticing the issue (we move fast for broken connections)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Healing the Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
